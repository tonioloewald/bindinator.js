# Integrating b8r

## b8r works the way you do

`b8r`'s `/dist` directory includes three builds of `b8r`:

- `b8r.mjs` for ES6 modules
- `b8r.js` (commonjs) for use with require
- `iife.js` for use via `<script src="path/to/iife.js"></script>` tag

(There are also corresponding minified versions and source maps.)

### Internally, b8r uses import()

`b8r` has migrated from using `require` to `import`. This is a _breaking change_ but
it had to happen sometime.

- `require` has been abolished in favor of `import`.
- `require.viaTag`, `require.lazy` and misc. support for legacy libraries has been 
  replaced with the much simpler `viaTag` from `scripts.js`.
- The `<script>` tag of components is implemented as an `AsyncFunction`.
- `data-component`  is being phased out in favor of `<b8r-component>`. (instead of
  `<div data-component="foo">...</div>` you can now write 
  `<b8r-component name="foo"></b8r-component>` and in fact you can write
  `<b8r-component path="path/to/foo"></b8r-component>` and the component will automatically
  be loaded)
- extensive support for `web-components` (a.k.a. "Custom Elements") is now available.

If you want to use `b8r` from a `<script>` tag, change it to `<script type="module">`
which will allow you to use `import` in any modern browser (i.e. not IE or Edge before 
Microsoft gave up and adopted Chromium, and not some other browsers that `b8r` already 
didn't care about).

Replace `require` with `import` throughout. Replace `module.exports = ...` with `export`.

You'll probably want this documentation on 
[import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) 
and [export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export).

If you'd prefer a potted summary, read onâ€¦

## ES6 Modules in 5 Minutes

This is for those of you who don't want to read all the documentation. (I don't blame you.)

`import` (a.k.a. "static import") is used in three ways:

    import foo from './path/to/foo.js';

Takes the `export default` from `foo.js` and assigns it to `const foo`.

    import {baz, lurman} from './path/to/bar.js';

Takes the specific exports from `bar.js` and sticks them in `const baz` and `const lurman`.

    import * as bar from './path/to/bar.js';

Takes all the specific exports from `bar.js` and makes them properties of `const bar = {...}`.

### Export

There are a ton of ways to export stuff from a library, but the ones you really need to
know about are:

    export default foo; // foo is what you'll get by importing the module

And:

    export const foo = 17; // foo is what you'll get by importing {foo} from the module
    export let foo = 17;   // as above, but foo will be a **reference**
    export { foo, ... };        // as above, but what you get depends on what foo is
    export { foo as baz, ... }; // as above, but you're renaming the export

A typical module pattern involves defining a bunch of stuff and then putting something like:

    // foo.js
    const bar = ...
    const baz = ...
    module.exports = {bar, baz}

at the bottom of the file. This can be replaced with:

    // foo.js
    const bar = ...
    const baz = ...
    export {bar, baz}

And then you can use either:

    import {bar} from './path/to/foo.js'

or:

    import * as foo from './path/to/foo.js'

You can also export something you've imported in one step, e.g.

    export {foo, bar} from './path/to/foo.js'
    export {default} from './path/to/something.js'
    export * from './path/to/something-else.js'

### Dynamic Import

Finally, there's **dynamic import**. You can only use `import` within a module context. 
In particular, code loaded at runtime and evaled inside a function is not such a 
context. (In `b8r` this means "component scripts".) Here, you need to use
the dynamic import pseudo-function, which works a bit like `require` but not really.

It works like this:

    const {bar, baz} = await import('./path/to/foo.js');

**Note**: `default` is treated like a **specific export named `default`** in a dynmically imported
module, so the equivalent of `import foo from "./foo.js"` is:

    const foo = (await import('./foo.js')).default

While the equivalent of `import * as foo from "./foo.js"` is:

    const foo = await import('./foo.js')

### Migrating to `import` by Example

Old way (**no longer works!**):

    <script src="path/to/require.js"></script>
    <script>
      const foo = require('lib/foo.js');
      const bar = require('lib/bar.js');
      const {baz} = require('path/to/lurman.js');
      ...

New Way:

    <script type="module">
      import foo from './lib/foo.js';          // foo has a default export
      import * as bar from './lib/bar.js';     // bar has no default export
      import {baz} from './path/to/lurman.js'; // lurman exports baz
      ...

Note that _relative import paths need to start with a `.`_, so `require('foo/bar.js')` becomes
`import('./foo/bar.js')`.

### Modernizing Libraries

In libraries, you'll need to replace `module.exports = foo` with `export`
statements. In general:

    export {foo} // import {foo} from 'path/to/foo.js';

Will prove more workable than:

    export default foo; // import foo from 'path/to/foo.js';

Because:

    const foo = await import 'path/to/foo.js'; // doesn't work?!

does not seem to work.

### Inside Component `<script>` Tags

Component `<script>` tags are inserted into an `AsyncFunction` that fires when a
component is inserted. So you cannot use static `import` inside a component's script
and must use **dynamic** `import(...)`.

So, within components, you'll need to rewrite imports from something like this:

    const foo = require('./path/to/foo.js'); // NO LONGER WORKS!

To something like this:

    const {foo} = await import('../path/to/foo.js');

(**Note**: right now, the import base path will be that of the context 
from which b8r.component was called, rather than the directory the component is in.)

### Legacy Libraries and `viaTag`

`lib/scripts.js` provides a `viaTag` function replaces `require.viaTag` 
and imports libraries as scripts when they do not support modules 
(which is most of them as of 2019).

E.g. to use `three.js`:

    const {viaTag} = await import('path/to/scripts.js');
    const {THREE} = await viaTag('path/to/three.js'); // viaTag resolves to window

This is clumsy, but the chance that a solid library will cause problems
this way is small, and all your application code will be tucked away in anonymous
closures.

The alternative, of course, is to use libraries that are implemented as ES6 modules
or modify them to do so.
