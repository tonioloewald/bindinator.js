# instance test
Copyright Â©2016-2022 Tonio Loewald
This component nests a bunch of instances of the hello component, showing
their private scopes in action, and also component composition.
These elements have different child elements and execute their scripts in unique contexts.
One of the components is nested in a component of the same type, and the two are still mutually independent.
One of the components has had its default `greeting` overridden using a `data` attribute.
